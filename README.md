# DSA in C#

Welcome to the DSA in C# repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C#. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

1. **Data Structures:**
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees
   - Graphs
   - Hash Tables
   - And more!

2. **Algorithms:**
   - Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
   - Sorting Algorithms (Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
   - Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, etc.)
   - Dynamic Programming
   - And more!

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the code in each directory. Each data structure and algorithm implementation is contained in its own file or directory.

You can also contribute to this repository by adding new implementations, fixing bugs, or improving existing code. Contributions are always welcome! ðŸŽ‰

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
